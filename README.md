## Motivation
mRNA half-life is important for mRNA surveillance and gene regulatory strategies. It has recently been shown that mRNA half-life can be estimated using high-throughput RNA-seq datasets, “without the need for metabolic labeling”. Although RNA-seq mostly generates reads that map to exons, it also captures less abundant intronic sequences, which originate from unspliced RNA molecules. This can be exploited to estimate mRNA half-life from the ratio of unsplit and split reads [3]. Despite this new flood of data, systematic studies mapping the effect of RNA half-life regulatory elements across human tissues have been lacking. The nature of the data and the problem makes deep learning sequence models a promising tool for unraveling the regulatory elements involved in mRNA stability regulation.
